# FROM UDEMY below

## The-wild-oasis

This is the final project of the React course on Udemy that displayed most of the more advanced techniques that were acquired over the course. The thought behind this application was it was a hotel app built for employees only. An account had to be created from another employee. From there they tracked bookings and cabins availabe to the company. I added the functionality of adding a new booking, and I am in the process of adding the capabilility to edit a booking. I will continue to add more whenever I get new ideas.
